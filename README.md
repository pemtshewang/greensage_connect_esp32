# Greensage Connect ESP32

This repository contains the code for the ESP32 board used in conjunction with the Greensage Connect mobile application. The ESP32 board is responsible for connecting to a broker and facilitating communication with the mobile app via Expo.

## Overview

The Greensage Connect project integrates an ESP32 microcontroller with the Greensage Connect mobile application. This repository focuses on the firmware and code running on the ESP32 board, enabling it to establish a connection to a message broker and communicate with the mobile app.

## Features

- **Broker Connectivity:** Code for connecting the ESP32 board to a message broker (e.g., MQTT) for communication.
- **Integration with Greensage Connect Mobile App:** Facilitating communication with the mobile app via Expo.

## Setup

To use this codebase:

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect your ESP32 board according to the hardware specifications and pin configurations mentioned in the code.
2. **Configuration:** Modify the configuration files or constants within the code to match your specific environment (e.g., Wi-Fi credentials, broker details).
3. **Flash the ESP32:** Use your preferred method or IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE) to flash the code onto the ESP32 board.

## Usage

1. Flash the code onto the ESP32 board.
2. Ensure the board is powered and connected to the configured Wi-Fi network.
3. The ESP32 will establish a connection to the message broker.
4. The mobile app (Greensage Connect) utilizing Expo can communicate with the ESP32 board once both are connected to the same network.

## Additional Notes

- This codebase assumes familiarity with ESP32 programming and configuration.
- It's recommended to secure your connections and credentials to prevent unauthorized access.
